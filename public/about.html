<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Daniel. I'm a Computer Science student and I already have a major
  in Biotechnology Engineering... which was a little bit useless btw. But well, here I am again enrolled in university. </p>

<p>I currently live in Heredia and I have two cats. <br />
  Tomas and Matilda. I love them and they are my reason for living. And I work because they need me to buy their greenies. LOL.

<p>My favorite singer is the handsome, the talented, the narcissistic... one of my personal favorites, Mr Harry Styles! <br/>
  I saw hiw live in concert in Mexico twice in 2022. One of the those was in front row and I almost died. Lol.
